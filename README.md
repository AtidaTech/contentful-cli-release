## âœ¨ Features

* **Branching & Releasing:** Seamless management of environments and releases in Contentful.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Designed for integration with CI/CD pipelines like GitLab or GitHub.
* **Command Line Utility:** Efficient command-line interface for all release-related tasks.

## ðŸ’¡ Installation

To use this helper library, you must have [NodeJS ðŸ”—](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm ðŸ”—](http://npmjs.org) installed.

To install it, simply run:

``````shell
npm install contentful-cli-release --save
``````

Or, if using [yarn ðŸ”—](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):

```shell
yarn add contentful-cli-release
```

Similarly, if you are using [Bun ðŸ”—](https://bun.sh), just run:

```shell
bun add contentful-cli-release
```

### Requirements

* `node` >= 18
* `npm` >= 9.5.0
* `contentful-management` >= 7.50.0
* [contentful-lib-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-lib-helpers) >= 0.3.0


### Set-up

To get the most out of the Contentful CLI Release tool, proper setup is crucial. Here's a step-by-step guide to help
you get started:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   The tool uses environment variables to simplify repetitive tasks and ensure security. Instead of passing sensitive 
   data as command line arguments every time, you can set them once in your environment. We recommend using a `.env` 
   file for this purpose. Here's a sample configuration:

   ```env
   CMS_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=placeholder-management-token
   CMS_SPACE_ID=placeholder-space-id
   CMS_RELEASE_MAX_SCHEDULED_ACTIONS=500
   CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_PROTECTED=dev,staging,master
   CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_REGEX=release-[0-9]+[\\.]*[0-9]*[\\.]*[0-9]*
   ```
   
   Create the `.env` or `.env.local` files in your project to override the default configuration. But ensure to 
   replace the placeholders (e.g., `placeholder-management-token` and `placeholder-space-id`) with your actual data.

[//]: # (CMS_RELEASE_SYNC_DB=./cli-release.db)
[//]: # (CMS_RELEASE_SYNC_CONFIG=./cli-release-config.js)

2. **Max Scheduled Actions**:
   The `CMS_RELEASE_MAX_SCHEDULED_ACTIONS` parameter sets the number of scheduled actions (in total) to be retrieved. 
   Default and maximum value is `500`.

3. **Protected Environments**:
   The `CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_PROTECTED` parameter lists environments that should not be modified by the tool, 
   ensuring safety for crucial stages like `dev`, `staging`, and `master`.

3. **Environment Naming Convention**:
   Using the `CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_REGEX`, you can specify a regex pattern to match the naming convention of your 
   release environments. The default pattern matches names like `release-1`, `release-1.1`, and `release-1.1.1`.

With these steps, you should have a fully configured environment ready to utilize the Contentful CLI Release tool 
effectively. Always refer back to the tool's documentation if you need further assistance.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Example

### Duplicate an Environment

Duplicates an existing environment to a new environment, and it pings to see when the new environment is available.
It skips the duplication if the destination environment already exists.

Usage:

```bash
npx contentful-cli-release --duplicate --from SOURCE_ENV --to DEST_ENV (--update-api-key)
```

Arguments:

- `--from`: The name of the source environment to duplicate from. Ie: 'master'.
- `--to`: The name of the destination environment to duplicate to. Ie: 'release-1.7.4' or 'staging'. 
- `--update-api-key`: It will enable, for the duplicated environment, the CDA API Key that has the same name of the 
  source environment (so, for environment 'master', the CDA API Key should be also called 'master').

> See the section [ðŸŽ¹ Usage](#-usage) for details on the command line options.

</details>

### Sync Schedule

Synchronize scheduled actions between two Environments, because the actions are not copied when duplicating an 
Environment. Ideally the source is the 'old' master and the destination is the newly created release environment.

Usage:

```bash
npx contentful-cli-release --sync-schedule --from SOURCE_ENV --to DEST_ENV (--force-yes)
```

Arguments:

- `--from`: The name of the source environment where the existing scheduled actions are. Ie: 'master'.
- `--to`: The name of the destination environment to copy the scheduled actions to. Ie: 'release-1.4.5'.
- `--force-yes`: When the destination environment is protected, this will allow to perform the action.

> See the section [ðŸŽ¹ Usage](#-usage) for details on the command line options.

#### Response and Errors

<details>
  <summary>Successful sync between two Environments</summary>

</details>

### Link Alias
It links an existing alias from one Environment to another one. This is used during a Release to move, for example,
the 'master' alias from the old release branch to the new one

Usage:

```bash
npx contentful-cli-release --link --alias ALIAS --environment-id TARGET_ENV (--prune-old-releases)
```

Arguments:

- `--alias`: The existing alias that needs to be updated. Ie: 'master'.
- `--to`: The target Environment-id to which the alias will point to. Ie: 'release-1.4.5'.
- `--prune-old-releases`: Using the release regular expression, it will delete all the older releases, except
the current one (ie: 'release-1.4.5') and the previous one (ie: 'release-1.4.4') that was associated with the 
'master' alias.

> See the section [ðŸŽ¹ Usage](#-usage) for details on the command line options.

#### Response and Errors

### Delete an Environment
This function allows to delete an Environment via the CLI tool. It automatically forbids to delete the 
configured protected environments, unless we use the option '--force-yes'.

Usage:

```bash
npx contentful-cli-release --delete --environment-id TARGET_ENV (--force-yes)
```

Arguments:

- `--environment-id`: The name of the environment to be deleted.
- `--force-yes`: When the destination environment is protected, this will allow to perform the action.

> See the section [ðŸŽ¹ Usage](#-usage) for details on the command line options.

#### Response and Errors

<details>
  <summary>Success when the environment is not protected</summary>

## ðŸŽ¹ Usage

This script can be used from the command line and accepts various arguments for customization:

* `--space-id`: The Contentful space id. It will override the env value `CMS_SPACE_ID`.
* `--management-token` or `--mt`: The Contentful Management Token. It will override the env value `CMS_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN`.
* `--from`: The source Environment-id when performing a duplication or a sync-schedule.
* `--alias`: Mandatory only for the link alias option. It represents the alias that we want to associate with another
Environment.
* `--to` or `--environment-id`: The target Environment-id.
* `--update-api-key`: When performing a duplication. It enables a CDA API Key also for the new environment. The only
constraint is that the API Key should have the same name of the source Environment. Ie: 'master' API Key for the 'master'
Environment, that will be enabled also for the new duplicated release Environment.
* `--prune-old-releases`: When running a `--link` alias operation, it will keep the latest two releases and delete the
older ones. The releases are identified by the regular expression defined in the env file or overridden via additional
command line parameter.
* `--force-yes`: It forces the operation when the target Environment-id is considered protected. The protected
Environments are listed in the env value `CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_PROTECTED` or overridden with the following option.
* `--protected-environments`: It sets a list (separated by comma) of protected environments. It overrides the env
value `CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_PROTECTED`. This prevents accidentally deleting or performing operations on an
Environment that is used for production or for important day-to-day work. Ie: 'dev,staging,master'.
* `--release-regex`: It overrides the env value `CMS_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT_REGEX`. It identifies a regular expression
that will match the release branch naming. The default one matches a fixed part `release-` and then the numbering
of a release, like `x.y.z`. The regular expression can be modified, however the script will use the numbering part
to do a natural ordering (so 1.4.10 is bigger than 1.4.9 and smaller than 1.5) when deciding which older releases
need to be automatically deleted when using `--prune-old-releases` option.
* `--max-scheduled-actions`: It overrides the env value `CMS_RELEASE_MAX_SCHEDULED_ACTIONS` and it represents the
total number of scheduled actions that should be retrieved. By default, the value is set to the maximum value allowed
of 500.

## ðŸš€ Managing a Release


## ðŸ“… Todo

* Add a `--sync-entries` option to sync entries between two release Environments.
* Add a `--help` command to describe the available command line options.
* Improve logging and error handling for more transparent releases.
* Incorporate feedback from the community to enhance tool capabilities.
